# Getting Started with Integrations

AIApp provides a wide range of integration options to help you easily connect your AI-powered application to other systems and services. Here are the steps to get started with integrations in AIApp:

## 1. Choose Your Integration

AIApp offers a variety of integrations with popular third-party tools, such as Salesforce, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. Choose the integration that best suits your needs and follow the documentation for that specific integration.

## 2. Authenticate Your Integration

To use an integration, you need to authenticate it with the appropriate credentials. Each integration has its own set of authentication requirements, so make sure to follow the documentation carefully.

## 3. Configure Your Integration

Once you've authenticated your integration, you'll need to configure it to work with your AI-powered application. This typically involves specifying which data should be shared between the two systems, setting up triggers and actions, and mapping fields between the systems.

## 4. Test Your Integration

After configuring your integration, it's important to test it to make sure everything is working as expected. AIApp provides testing tools and sandboxes to help you test your integrations in a safe and controlled environment.

## 5. Monitor Your Integration

Once your integration is up and running, it's important to monitor it to ensure that it continues to work properly. AIApp provides monitoring tools and dashboards to help you keep an eye on your integrations and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

With these simple steps, you can easily integrate your AI-powered application with other systems and services to create a more powerful and efficient workflow. For more information about integrations in AIApp, check out our [Integrations Documentation](/integrations).
